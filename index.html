    <p>Science Hack Day brings together designers, developers, scientists, and other geeks in the same physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking and building cool stuff.</p>
    
    <p> The mission of Science Hack Day is to get excited and make things with science! A Hack Day is a 48-hour-all-night event that brings together designers, developers, scientists, citizen scientists, web geeks and anyone with good ideas in the same physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking, and building "cool stuff". Hack Days were originally created by Yahoo! in 2005 and soon after became a worldwide trend. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period, small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable results. Some Hack Days have a specific focus. There have already been very successful Music Hack Days and Government Hack Days. It's time for a Hack Day focused on science</p>

    <p>To get a feel for the energy and passion of the event check out this video from Science Hack Day San Francisco 2014.</P>

    <h3 >Timetable</h3>
    <p>Science Hack days are very free-form events with teams self organizing and working together independently throughout the day. We provide the space and some equipment but most of all we provide the freedom to work on something uninterrupted for 30 hours. To encourage as much creativity and science hacking as possible we have a very light timetable of structure throughout the day. Here are just a few times to be aware of.

  <section id="who" class='row who_should_come'>
    <h2 id='participants' class='large-centered columns' >Who should come along?</h2>

    <p>Absolutely anyone can come along to science hack day no matter what skill set they bring. We need scientists, engineers, educators, tinkerers, storytellers, artists, game makers, writers and people who are just curious.</p>
    <p>On the day different people get involved in different ways. We have tried to collect together some of these different hack day personalities</p>

      <div class='subject_headers'>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width=150 src='img/expert.png'></img>
          <h3>The Expert</h3>
          <p>This attendee has come with a vast depth of knowledge on a subject. Perhaps an astrochemist, or a marine biologist, he has the facts to help guide the projects and make them applicable in museums and the real world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width=150 src='img/idea.png'></img>
          <h3>The Idea Person</h3>
          <p>This attendee has come with a hack idea in mind, and he need others with additional skills in order to flesh out the idea. These are good people to watch out for if this is your first hack day and you're not sure what to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width=150 src='img/gunhire.png'></img>
          <h3>The Gun for Hire</h3>
          <p>This attendee is an all-star in her field and has a valuable skill set, perhaps an eye for design, or hardware hacking skills. She is willing to help where she can. She may move from project to project offering specific help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width=150 src='img/helper.png'></img>
          <h3>The Helper</h3>
          <p>This attendee has come to the event without an agenda. He overhears what seems to him like the best idea anyone has ever had, and is immediately hooked. He’s thrilled to make the endeavor become a reality.</p>

  <section id="what" class='row stuff_to_hack_on'>
    <h2 id='hacks' class='large-centered columns'>What to make?</h2>
    <p>Hacks can take many forms. Some are technical, like building a mask to simulate synethsesia while some are about creating new media like a children's book. There is something for everyone no matter what your background or skill set. Check out a few of our favorite projects from last years science hack day: </p>

    <div class='row no_border'>
      <div class='hack columns large-4 text-center'>
        <img src="img/GKImage.png"></img>
        <h3>Galaxy Karaoke</h3>
        <p>Using galaxies that happen to resemble the shapes of letters to spell out the lyrics to David Bowie's: A Space Oddity, this team created a Karaoke system the like of which the world has never seen. Projected on to the dome of the Grainger Sky Theater onlookers could sing along by reading the galaxies flying at them through space. </p>
      </div>

      <div class='hack columns large-4 text-center'>
        <img src="img/Simge.png"></img>
        <h3>Synistesia</h3>
        <p>Wouldn't it be cool if you could feel sight? That's what one team of sciencehackers sought to explore, creating a mask that simulated synesthesia, a condition where senses get mixed up (e.g. associating colors with numbers or seeing ripples in your vision resulting from loud sounds). </p>
      </div>

      <div class='hack columns large-4 text-center'>
        <img src="img/DNAImage.png"></img>
        <h3>DNAquiri</h3>
        <p> What does DNA taste like? Despite the copious amount of food present at Science Hack Day, a band of biohackers were hungry for more. They sought out to craft a recipe for extracting strawberry DNA that didn't require indigestible ingredients.</p>
      </div>


    </div>

    <p>Bring along anything you like but the Adler also has some pretty cool unique things to hack on to. Including a 3D printer, the worlds largest highest resolution planetarium dome, countless touch tables, high altitude balloons and much more!</p>
