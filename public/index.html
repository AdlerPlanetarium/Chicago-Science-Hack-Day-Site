    <p>Science Hack Day brings together designers, developers, scientists, and other geeks in the same physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking and building cool stuff.</p>
    
    <p> The mission of Science Hack Day is to get excited and make things with science! A Hack Day is a 30-hour-all-night event that brings together designers, developers, scientists, citizen scientists, web geeks and anyone with good ideas in the same physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking, and building "cool stuff". Hack Days were originally created by Yahoo! in 2005 and soon after became a worldwide trend. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period, small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable results. </p>

    <p>To get a feel for the energy and passion of the event check out this video from Science Hack Day San Francisco 2014.</P>

    <h3>Timetable</h3>
    <p>Hack days are very free-form events with teams self organizing and working together independently throughout the day. The Adler provides space and some equipment but most of all we provide the freedom to work on something uninterrupted for 24 hours. To encourage as much creativity and science hacking as possible we have a very light timetable of structure throughout the day. Here are just a few times of which you should be aware.</p>

    <h2 id='participants' class='large-centered columns'>Who should come along?</h2>
    <p>Anyone can come along to Science Hack Day Chicago no matter what skill set you bring. We need scientists, engineers, educators, tinkerers, storytellers, artists, game makers, writers, and people who are just curious.</p>
    <p>On the day different people get involved in different ways. Here are some of different hack day personalities.</p>

        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width="150" src='img/expert.png'></img>
          <h3>The Expert</h3>
          <p>This attendee comes with a vast depth of knowledge in a subject. Perhaps an astrochemist, or a marine biologist, and has the facts to help guide the projects and make them applicable in museums and the real world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width="150" src='img/idea.png'></img>
          <h3>The Idea Person</h3>
          <p>This attendee comes with a hack idea in mind. This person needs others with additional skills in order to flesh out the idea and turn it into a reality. These are good people to watch out for if this is your first hack day or you're not sure what to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width="150" src='img/gunhire.png'></img>
          <h3>The Gun for Hire</h3>
          <p>This attendee is an all-star in her respective field and has a valuable skill set, perhaps an eye for design, or hardware hacking skills. This person is willing to help where she can. She may move from project to project offering specific help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subject columns large-3 text-center'>
          <img width="150" src='img/helper.png'></img>
          <h3>The Helper</h3>
          <p>This attendee comes to the event without an agenda. Often she overhears an awesome idea and is immediately hooked. The Helper is thrilled to make the endeavor become a reality.</p>

  <section id="what" class='row stuff_to_hack_on'>
    <h2 id='hacks' class='large-centered columns'>What to make?</h2>
    <p>Hacks can take many forms. Some are technical, like building a mask to simulate synethsesia while some are about creating new media like a children's book. There is something for everyone no matter what your background or skill set. Check out a few of our favorite projects from past science hack day events: </p>

        <h3>Galaxy Karaoke</h3>
        <p>Using galaxies that happen to resemble the shapes of letters to spell out the lyrics to David Bowie's: A Space Oddity, this team created a Karaoke system the like of which the world has never seen. Projected on to the dome of the Grainger Sky Theater onlookers could sing along by reading the galaxies flying at them through space. </p>
      </div>

      <div class='hack columns large-4 text-center'>
        <img src="img/Simge.png"></img>
        <h3>Synistesia</h3>
        <p>Wouldn't it be cool if you could feel sight? That's what one team of sciencehackers sought to explore, creating a mask that simulated synesthesia, a condition where senses get mixed up (e.g. associating colors with numbers or seeing ripples in your vision resulting from loud sounds). </p>
      </div>

      <div class='hack columns large-4 text-center'>
        <img src="img/DNAImage.png"></img>
        <h3>DNAquiri</h3>
        <p> What does DNA taste like? Despite the copious amount of food present at Science Hack Day, a band of biohackers were hungry for more. They sought out to craft a recipe for extracting strawberry DNA that didn't require indigestible ingredients.</p>
